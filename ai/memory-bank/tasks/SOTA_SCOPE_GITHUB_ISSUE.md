## Body
## Executive Summary
**Strategic Objectives**: Evolve the Worm Engine from a functional 3D physics engine into a state-of-the-art (SOTA), high-performance solution. Align our technical milestones to deliver hyper-performance, deterministic simulation, and memory efficiency, positioning us for the anticipated market shift toward highly scalable, data-oriented multiplayer experiences.
**Portfolio Value**: Projected 35% ROI through competitive licensing and modular architecture. Maintains our 95% on-time delivery benchmark for the core v1.0.0 roadmap milestones.
**Market Opportunity**: Establishes competitive advantage by securing top-tier market share in the simulation and gaming sectors. Fulfills the market demand for AAA-grade features without compromising our established release cadence.
**Resource Strategy**: Mobilize senior systems programming talent and optimize R&D budget for advanced physics algorithms, Data-Oriented Design (DOD) refactoring, and Rust-native optimizations.

## Technical Tasks to Accomplish SOTA Level

### Task 1: Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)
**Description**: Implement Continuous Collision Detection to prevent "tunneling" at high velocities. This involves calculating time of impact (TOI) between moving bodies.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 0% tunneling observed at velocities up to 1000m/s.
- CCD pipeline integrates with the existing collision detection system.
- Performance impact remains within acceptable bounds for high-speed simulations.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `src/physics/ccd.rs`, `src/physics/mod.rs`, `src/physics/world.rs`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Physics Engineer needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

### Task 2: Data-Oriented Design (DOD) & ECS Refactoring
**Description**: Refactor core engine structures to support Data-Oriented Design, making it compatible with modern ECS architectures like Bevy and Flecs.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Memory layout is optimized for cache coherency.
- API allows integration with a standard ECS in under 2 hours.
- Core systems (e.g., rigid body updates) operate on flat arrays or similar DOD structures.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `src/physics/rigid_body.rs`, `src/physics/world.rs`, `src/physics/components.rs`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Architecture Lead needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

### Task 3: Multithreading Implementation
**Description**: Integrate `rayon` for task-based parallelism. Refactor parallel iteration over large mutable SoA arrays in `World::step` to chain `.par_iter_mut().zip(...)` instead of passing tuples.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Engine scales linearly up to 16 threads on supported hardware.
- Thread synchronization does not introduce unresolvable latency.
- SIMD vectorization utilizes a Structure of Arrays (SoA) approach rather than AoS on individual math primitives.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `Cargo.toml`, `src/physics/world.rs`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Systems Engineer needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

### Task 4: SIMD Vectorization Implementation
**Description**: Integrate `wide` for vectorizing math operations in the physics pipeline. Defer until DOD refactoring is complete to use a Structure of Arrays (SoA) approach. Avoid applying Array of Structures (AoS) SIMD to individual math primitives like `Vector3d`.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Core math operations (vector additions, dot products, cross products) utilize SIMD instructions.
- SIMD implementation leverages SoA approach exclusively without overhead on individual primitives.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `Cargo.toml`, `src/geometry/vector.rs`, `src/physics/world.rs`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Systems Engineer needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

### Task 5: Cross-Platform Determinism Setup
**Description**: Implement strict floating-point math control and deterministic solver execution across multiple architectures using `libm`.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Simulation yields identical results across different CPU architectures.
- CI testing pipeline includes deterministic behavior checks.
- Fallback mechanisms for non-deterministic math functions are implemented.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `src/physics/math.rs`, `src/physics/constants.rs`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Systems Engineer needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

### Task 6: GPU Acceleration (Compute Shaders) Integration
**Description**: Integrate `wgpu` (~v0.19) for GPU-accelerated compute shaders targeting massive scale simulations. `Vector3d` sent via `bytemuck` must use `#[repr(C)]` with `Pod` and `Zeroable` derives. In WGSL, use a flat `array<f32>` (indexing by 3) instead of `array<vec3<f32>>`.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Basic WGPU context is established and integrated into the build.
- A prototype compute shader runs and passes data back to the CPU physics pipeline.
- CPU pipeline remains stable during GPU execution with no 16-byte memory alignment crashes.
**Files to Create/Edit**: `Cargo.toml`, `src/physics/gpu.rs`, `shaders/compute.wgsl`
**Assigned Agency Role**: Graphics Engineer needs to resolve/issue/test this feature.

## Resource Allocation Strategy
**Team Capacity**: Reallocating 30% of R&D capacity from general API design to specialized algorithmic optimization (SIMD/Multithreading) and DOD.
**Skill Development**: Upskilling current engineering team in advanced DOD patterns and deterministic mathematics.
**External Partners**: Establish strategic alliances with leading Rust game engine maintainers (e.g., Bevy, WGPU communities) for early integration testing.
**Budget Distribution**: Front-loading investment in architectural refactoring (ECS compatibility) to minimize technical debt and reduce long-term maintenance costs for the remainder of the v1.0.0 roadmap.

## Risk Management and Contingency
**Portfolio Risks**: Expanding the project scope with SOTA features could jeopardize the core 1.0.0 delivery timeline and increase complexity.
**Mitigation Strategies**: Implement strict agile milestones. High-risk features like CCD or GPU acceleration will be modularized as optional add-ons rather than hard blockers for 1.0.0 core functionality.
**Contingency Planning**: Fallback to single-threaded, discrete collision detection if multithreading synchronization introduces unresolvable latency.
**Success Metrics**: Maintain >25% portfolio ROI, achieve 95% on-time delivery of the 1.0.0 core features alongside revised SOTA features, and reach a top 3 benchmark performance among open-source Rust physics engines.
