# Worm Engine Development Tasks

## Specification Summary
**Original Requirements**: "Evolve the Worm Engine from a functional 3D physics engine into a state-of-the-art (SOTA), high-performance solution. Align our technical milestones to deliver hyper-performance, deterministic simulation, and memory efficiency"
**Technical Stack**: Rust, rayon, wide, libm, wgpu, WGSL
**Target Timeline**: v1.0.0

## Development Tasks

### [ ] Task 1: Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) Implementation
**Description**: Implement Continuous Collision Detection to prevent "tunneling" at high velocities. This involves calculating time of impact (TOI) between moving bodies. Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) Implementation needs to be resolved/issued/tested by the Physics Engineer.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 0% tunneling observed at velocities up to 1000m/s.
- CCD pipeline integrates with the existing collision detection system.
- Performance impact remains within acceptable bounds for high-speed simulations.

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- src/physics/ccd.rs
- src/physics/mod.rs
- src/physics/world.rs

### [ ] Task 2: Data-Oriented Design (DOD) & ECS Refactoring
**Description**: Refactor core engine structures to support Data-Oriented Design, making it compatible with modern ECS architectures like Bevy and Flecs. Data-Oriented Design (DOD) & ECS Refactoring needs to be resolved/issued/tested by the Architecture Lead.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Memory layout is optimized for cache coherency.
- API allows integration with a standard ECS in under 2 hours.
- Core systems (e.g., rigid body updates) operate on flat arrays or similar DOD structures.

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- src/physics/rigid_body.rs
- src/physics/world.rs
- src/physics/components.rs

### [ ] Task 3: Multithreading and SIMD Vectorization
**Description**: Integrate `rayon` for task-based parallelism and `std::simd` for vectorizing math operations in the physics pipeline. Multithreading and SIMD Vectorization needs to be resolved/issued/tested by the Systems Engineer.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Engine scales linearly up to 16 threads on supported hardware.
- Core math operations (vector additions, dot products, cross products) utilize SIMD instructions.
- Thread synchronization does not introduce unresolvable latency.

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- Cargo.toml
- src/geometry/vector.rs
- src/physics/world.rs

### [ ] Task 4: Cross-Platform Determinism Setup
**Description**: Implement strict floating-point math control and deterministic solver execution across multiple architectures. Cross-Platform Determinism Setup needs to be resolved/issued/tested by the Systems Engineer.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Simulation yields identical results across different CPU architectures.
- CI testing pipeline includes deterministic behavior checks.
- Fallback mechanisms for non-deterministic math functions are implemented.

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- src/physics/math.rs
- src/physics/constants.rs
- Tests related to cross-platform execution.

### [ ] Task 5: GPU Acceleration (Compute Shaders) Integration
**Description**: Future-proof the engine by integrating WGPU for GPU-accelerated compute shaders, initially targeting massive scale simulations like soft-bodies or fluids. GPU Acceleration (Compute Shaders) Integration needs to be resolved/issued/tested by the Graphics Engineer.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Basic WGPU context is established and integrated into the build.
- A prototype compute shader runs and passes data back to the CPU physics pipeline.
- CPU pipeline remains stable during GPU execution.

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- Cargo.toml
- src/physics/gpu.rs
- shaders/compute.wgsl
