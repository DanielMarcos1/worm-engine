# Worm Engine

My homemade 3D physics engine. This project aims to create a fully functional physics engine capable of calculations at high performance (yeah, i use rust).

## Roadmap for 1.0.0

Each version have a goal to be considered "ready", any bugs found in those positions will lead to hotfixes, if it does, the goal will go from "0.x.0" to "0.x.x".
### 0.2.0

- Rigid body dinamics movement

- Kinematics and Newton's Laws

- Gravity, Friction, and Air Resistance

### 0.3.0

- Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

- Impulse-based Resolution

- Restitution and Friction

### 0.4.0

- Broad-phase and Narrow-phase Collision Detection

- Time Step Management

### 0.5.0

- Soft Body Dinamics

- Constraints and Joints

- Integrators

### 0.6.0

- API design and code modularity

### 0.7.0

- Debug functionalities

### 0.8.0

- Integration with graphics library

### 1.0.0

- All the features before and full documentation.
